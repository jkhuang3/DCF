# DCF
This is a place where I will model the DCF given in the Georgia Tech Investments Committee Modeling Template

I will first pull the necessary data from the Bloomberg Terminal. Then I will use this data in order to perform a Discounted Cash Flow Analysis based on the template that was developed by the Georgia Tech Investments Committee. Here is the link to the template: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O9GwAE620RLyJ-sETMDXzS9WJaajQSuR/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=107974447353321728554&rtpof=true


In addition, after calculating this, I will then add a Monte Carlo Simulation to add variations in data to create a more "accurate" simulation.
